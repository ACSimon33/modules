INSTALLING ON UNIX:
	1. make sure tclsh is installed in your path.

	2. untar the modules/tcl directory in a global place that all users 
		can see.  (A NFS shared directory or a SAMBA share for example)
		I use the following scheme:
			/soft/rko-modules/tcl contains everything in this dir 
				including the init directory.
			/soft/rko-modules/modulefiles contains our module files.

	3. run 'make' 
		This adds the path to your MODULESHOME directory to the 
		"init scripts". It also creates a default modulesrc file.

	4. Setup your modulesfiles directory.  If your using modules for the 
		first time, you probably want to copy the main modulefiles 
		that get installed with the c version of modules.  Or you
		can copy the files in contrib/modulefiles:
		cp -r contrib/modulefiles modulefiles

	5. Setup your  'modulerc' file to point to the place where
		your modulefiles are stored(The directory you 
		created in step 4).

	6. instruct users to source the appropriate file inside the init/
   		directory.  For example lets say I have installed my modules in
		the directory /soft/rko-modules and the init files are in:
			/soft/rko-modules/init 
		a tcsh user I would tell to add the following line to their 
		.tcshrc:
 			source /soft/rko-modules/init/tcsh
		a zsh user I would tell to add the following line to their 
		.profile:
 			. /soft/rko-modules/init/zsh

		Some shells have multiple ways they initalize depending on
		if they are interactive or not.  Look at contrib/template
		for some example init files.
