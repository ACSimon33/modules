# This file sets up the basic directories you want to search for modules
# for all users.
# IF you do not currently have any modulefiles, a nice way to start is to
# make a modulefiles directory and copy contrib/modulefiles to it, then
# point the following line at that location.
# You can also look at test/modulefiles for more examples, some of these
# are a bit hard to read though.
module use /soft/modules/modulefiles
